# Reveal-Slides-for-OBS
reveal.js Plugin to use the Speaker Viewer in OBS.  

reveal.js is the HTML presentation framework for creating stunning presentations on the web. 
OBS Studio is a free and open source software for video recording and live streaming.  OBS can play reveal.js slides in its embedded browser.  One limitation is that the OBS Browser doesn't allow pop up windows.  This means the reveal.js Speaker View can't open üò¢

The Reveal Slides for OBS plugin modifies the Speaker View so that a pop up window is not needed üôå.  The Speaker View and Slides are added to OBS as separate Browser Sources and WebSocket messages keep them in sync.
